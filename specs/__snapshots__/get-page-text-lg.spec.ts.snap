In this paper we present the design and implementation of Flow, a fast and precise type checker for JavaScript
that is used by thousands of developers on millions of lines of code at Facebook every day. Flow uses
sophisticated type inference to understand common JavaScript idioms precisely. This helps it find non-trivial
bugs in code and provide code intelligence to editors without requiring significant rewriting or annotations from
the developer. We formalize an important fragment of Flow’s analysis and prove its soundness. Furthermore,
Flow uses aggressive parallelization and incrementalization to deliver near-instantaneous response times.
This helps it avoid introducing any latency in the usual edit-refresh cycle of rapid JavaScript development. We
describe the algorithms and systems infrastructure that we built to scale Flow’s analysis.

INTRODUCTION

JavaScript is one of the most popular languages for writing web and mobile applications today. The
language facilitates fast prototyping of ideas via dynamic typing. The runtime provides the means
for fast iteration on those ideas via dynamic compilation. This fuels a fast edit-refresh cycle, which
promises an immersive coding experience that is quite appealing to creative developers.
However, evolving and growing a JavaScript codebase is notoriously challenging. Developers
spend a lot of time debugging silly mistakes—like mistyped property names, out-of-order arguments,
references to missing values, checks that never fail due to implicit conversions, and so on—and
worse, unraveling assumptions and guarantees in code written by others. In many other languages,
this overhead is mitigated by having a layer of types over the code and building tools for the
developer that use type information. For example, types can be used to identify common bugs and
to document interfaces of libraries. Our aim is to bring such type-based tooling to JavaScript.

1.1
Goals

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Flow, a static type checker for JavaScript
we have built and have been using at Facebook for the past three years.
The idea of using types to manage code evolution and growth in JavaScript (and related languages)
is not new. In fact, several useful type systems have been built for JavaScript in recent years. The
design and implementation of Flow are driven by the specific demands of real-world JavaScript
development we have observed at Facebook and the industry at large.

• The type checker must be able to cover large parts of the codebase without requiring too
many changes in the code. Developers want precise answers to code intelligence queries (the
type of an expression, the definition reaching a reference, the set of possible completions at a
point). Relatedly, they want to catch a large number of common bugs with few false positives.

• The type checker must provide very fast responses, even on a very large codebase. Developers
do not want any noticeable “compile-time” latency in their normal workflow, because that
would defeat the whole purpose of using JavaScript.
To meet these demands, we had to make careful choices and solve technical challenges in Flow
that go beyond related existing systems.

• We precisely model common JavaScript idioms that appear pervasively in a modern JavaScript
codebase. For example, Flow understands the pattern x = x || 0 that, e.g., initializes an
optional parameter x in a function body. Handling a case like this necessitates support for
type refinements: the system needs to recognize that the assigned value will not be null
or undefined, i.e., the type of the initial value of x must be refined to exclude falsy values.1

(More examples are shown below.)

• At the same time, we do not focus on reflection and legacy patterns that appear in a relatively
small fraction (that is also usually stable and well-tested). Today, tools like Babel convert
modern JavaScript to (the more low-level) ES5 executed on browsers. Flow focuses on
analyzing the source, instead of the target, of such translations (unlike many previous efforts
that address ES5, or the even more low-level, and therefore harder, ES3).

• We modularize our constraint-based analysis and implement data structures, algorithms,
and systems infrastructure for parallel computing, shared-memory communication, and
incremental updates to scale to millions of lines of code while answering most queries in
well under a second.

1.2
Overview

We now introduce the main ideas behind Flow’s design and implementation. (A full description of
Flow is not possible due to space constraints.)

Precise type checking. One of the main contributors of Flow’s precision is path-sensitivity: the
way types interact with runtime tests. The essence of many JavaScript idioms is to put together ad
hoc sets of runtime values and to take them apart with shallow, structural (in)equality checks. In
Flow, the set of runtime values that a variable may contain is described by its type, and a runtime
test on that variable refines the type to a smaller set. This ability turns out to be quite powerful and
general in practice.
In this paper, we formalize refinements in a core subset of JavaScript. The system is particularly
interesting because of the combination of mutable local variables and closures that capture them by
reference. Next, we illustrate this system via a series of examples (Figure 1).
Higher-order functions (lines 1–4) are quite common in JavaScript. Unfortunately, it is also
common to use null as a default for everything (line 4). In particular, this causes the dreaded “null
is not a function” error to hit often. Fortunately, Flow finds these errors by following flows of null
to calls in the code.
Checking for nullability is the idiomatic way to prevent such errors at runtime. (In JavaScript,
the check f != null is equivalent to f !== null && f !== undefined, which additionally rules
out undefined, commonly used to denote missing values.) Thankfully Flow understands that this
code is safe. It refines the type of f to filter out null in line 6, and thus knows that null cannot
reach the call. Many other idiomatic variants also work, such as f && f(x), where f is checked to
be truthy (ruling out null, undefined and other falsy values) before calling.
Refinements also power a common technique to encode algebraic data types in JavaScript, which
are used quite widely (to manage actions and dispatchers, data and queries, etc. in user interface

1The values false, 0, "", null, undefined, and NaN are falsy. All other values are truthy.

libraries). Records of different shapes have a common property that specifies the “constructor,” and
other properties dependent on the constructor value. These records are then analyzed by “pattern
matching”—inspecting and branching on the constructor value.
For example, consider the encoding of lists in lines 8–11. A sum function (line 12) checks whether
a list is non-empty before accessing properties specific to non-empty lists. Following the calls
to sum, Flow knows that the parameter list in line 12 can contain both kinds of objects—those
whose kind property is "cons", and those for which it is "nil". The latter ones are filtered out
by refining the type of list in line 13, so that the only objects reaching the property accesses of
head and tail in line 14 are guaranteed to have those properties. Thus, Flow knows that this
code is safe. Without refinements, on the other hand, the analysis would have over-conservatively
concluded that nil can also flow to the property accesses, leading to spurious type errors.
Refinements are tracked by a flow-sensitive analysis, and interact in interesting ways with
variable assignment. The common idiom in line 20 of merge ensures that a variable has a non-null
default. Flow models the assignment by merging the refined type of x with the type of nil and
updating the type of x with it.
On the other hand, refinements can be invalidated by assignments, which can even happen
indirectly via calls (line 26). While invalidating refinements is necessary for soundness, they should
be preserved as much as possible to avoid spurious type errors. Flow tracks variable assignments
as effects for precise invalidation.
Refinements and their invalidation carry over to higher-order functions. We also have limited
support for refining mutable object properties, but those refinements are invalidated aggressively
(i.e., our analysis is not heap-sensitive).
Behind the scenes, Flow relies on set-based analysis as a common low-level “assembly language”
for encoding a wide variety of high-level analyses. Compared with pure unification, this affords far
more precision, but is much less efficient (quasi-cubic vs. quasi-linear in program size). How do we
scale such an analysis?

Fast type checking. The key to Flow’s speed is modularity: the ability to break the analysis into
file-sized chunks that can be assembled later. Fortunately, JavaScript is already written using files

as modules, so we modularize our analysis simply by asking that modules have explicitly typed
signatures. (We still infer types for the vast majority of code “local” to modules.) Coincidentally,
developers consider this good software engineering practice anyway.
With modularity, we can aggressively parallelize our analysis. Furthermore, when files change,
we can incrementally re-analyze only those files that depend on the changed files, and avoid
re-analysis when their typed signatures have not changed. Together, these choices have helped
scale the analysis to millions of lines of code.
Under the hood, Flow relies on a high-throughput low-latency systems infrastructure that
enables distribution of tasks among parallel workers, and communication of results in parallel
via shared memory. Combined with an architecture where the analysis of a codebase is updated
automatically in the background on file system changes, Flow delivers near-instantaneous feedback
as the developer edits and rebases code, even in a large repository.

1.3
Contributions

Overall, this paper (and our work on Flow) shows how, through careful design and implementation,
type checking for JavaScript can be both extremely fast and precise enough in practice. We make
the following contributions.

(1) We identify a lightweight form of type refinement as a crucial feature for supporting a variety
of common JavaScript idioms in practice. We formalize inference to support refinements in a
core fragment of JavaScript containing higher-order functions, mutable variables, runtime
tests, and capture-by-reference. Knowing when to invalidate a refinement can be quite
tricky in this setting (Sections 3.1 and 3.2). To the best of our knowledge, no prior work
has formalized this subset of features in a type inference for JavaScript. We also discuss
our implementation of type inference as a system of set-based constraints combined with
unification for optimization (Section 3.4). We define a runtime semantics (Section 4) and
prove our system safe (Section 5) with respect to it.

(2) We show how our inference system can be extended to check type annotations. Union types
introduce some interesting complications (Section 6). We then identify a lightweight way
to use type annotations to modularize our analysis, piggybacking on existing best practices
in JavaScript development such as breaking a codebase into several small modules and
documenting types at their boundaries (Section 7).

(3) We show how we can exploit modularity and dependency management to make Flow
responsive at scale. We describe an algorithm for parallelizing and incrementally updating
the analysis when files change (Section 8). We describe how we extend an existing system
infrastructure for parallel computation and communication, and implement our algorithms
on it to achieve high throughput and low latency (Section 9).

(4) We perform a thorough experimental evaluation of Flow on a codebase with millions of
lines of JavaScript. Through key metrics we demonstrate the behavior of various stages of
type checking at scale, and validate our hypotheses on the precision gained by refinement
tracking and our low annotation footprint. (Section 10).

We conclude with a discussion of related work (Section 11) and of limitations and threats to
validity (Section 12).

are mostly orthogonal to understanding refinements. Their type inference, while interesting, is
built on the same foundations, and behave more or less similarly to previous work—we can safely
extend our model to include them, without significantly complicating our guarantees. Our focus is
on formalizing type inference and refinement strengthening, with the exception of refinements on
mutable fields that are not tracked through the heap. While compact, this fragment is expressive
enough to model the examples of Section 1—which illustrate how Flow uses predicate refinements
to reduce false positives, while remain sound with respect to variable updates.

2.1
Syntax

Figure 2 describes the language of expressions e and statements s. Here, n represents constants, and
x and y range over program variables.

Expressions. We elide primitive operations (which may include arithmetic operations). Constants
include, e.g., numbers, strings, and undefined. The syntax p(x) draws from a fixed, possibly infinite
set of unary predicates p on x. These model dynamic checks, such as typeof x === "number",
x === undefined, x (testing if an expression is truthy), or model tests like x.f === "nil" on
records. Note that in this system the last check does not imply a predicate on the value of x.f, but
rather on x itself. The former would be a heap refinement, which Flow only supports in a limited
fashion, and which is excluded from the formalism.
General-purpose functions (using the keyword function) are complicated in JavaScript: they
can be additionally used as methods and as constructors. To simplify our exposition, we restrict our
attention to arrow functions (essentially lambdas). We assume that a function body consists of a
statement followed by the return of an expression. Functions that do not explicitly return anything
can be thought of as implicitly returning undefined. (Flow’s treatment of abnormal control flows
via return is also interesting, but we omit it here.) We also include the logical conjunction (&&),
disjunction (||) and negation (!) operators, as they are pervasive in JavaScript and inform our
refinement strategy.

Statements. We use var to introduce variables, and include statements for conditional execution
and sequencing. We omit const because it is much simpler than var, since refinements never
need to be invalidated. We also omit let-bound variables. Their main difference with var-bound
variables is in scoping rules, so handling them does not add any insight to our type system overview.
Finally, we omit while; although it can be encoded with if and recursion, Flow’s treatment of it is
more precise.

Assumption. We assume an α-renaming pre-pass over the program’s AST that guarantees that
each variable definition point (which is either a var statement or an arrow definition) introduces a
unique variable identifier. This is a fairly straightforward transformation for any preprocessor that
helps avoid unintentional capture of variables in exported closures.

2.2
Types, Effects and Constraints

The basic ingredients of our constraint system are types τ and effects ε. Their syntax is described in
Figure 3.

Types. Types are ranged over by variables α, β, etc. taken from an enumerable set V. The building
blocks for constructing complex type structures are type literals ˆτ. These include primitive types b
(e.g., number, string, and void for undefined), arrow types α
ε−→ τ for functions, and record types
{f1 : α1, . . . , fn : αn}. Arrow types are annotated with an effect ε which describes a set of names x
that may be assigned in the function’s body or transitively in code that is executed when calling
this function. A more proper introduction of effects follows. Types also feature a binary operator ⊔
denoting the union of types.

Effects. The effect we are interested in tracking here is variable updates. Each language term is
associated with an effect, as we will see later in constraint generation. This is (roughly) the set of
variables that are (re)assigned within this term. The base constructors of effects are the empty effect
⊥ and variable symbols x, corresponding to the variables that are updated. Like types, effects also
feature a binary operator ⊔ denoting union of effects. Finally, effects are ranged over by variables
ω taken from an enumerable set E.

Environments. An environment Γ binds variables x to entries τ α, meaning that its most recent
assignment was of type τ, whereas the type variable α is used as the collective summary for all
its (past, current, and future) assignments. Here τ is flow-sensitive—its value may change from
one (flow-sensitive) environment to another—whereas α is invariant. We also distinguish between
environment extension—denoted Γ, x : τ α (variable x is not bound in the original environment Γ),
and environment update—denoted Γ[x �→ τ α ] (variable x was bound in Γ).

Predicates. Key to our type refining process is the notion of predicates. A predicate P is a clause
denoting a property of its implied argument. In our setting, syntactically it can be a base predicate
p or its negation. Base predicates describe properties of constructed or primitive types. For the
remaining sections we will keep these predicates abstract, but examples of these predicates are
"

"Fast and Precise Type Checking for JavaScript
7

the ones implied by checks of the form typeof ⋆ === "string", typeof ⋆ === "number",
⋆.f === "null", etc., where ⋆ is to be filled in with a program variable.

Constraints. A constraint c is a “flow” from a type τ (resp. effect ε) to a type use uτ (resp. an
effect use uε). Flows from types to type uses generalize the notion of subtyping. However, we
chose to enforce some structural restrictions to the forms that can appear on the right-hand side
of constraints, namely the uses. Type and effect variables can appear as uses themselves. We do
not allow general types and effects to appear as uses. Instead they are wrapped by constructors
that contain information about the operations that caused the generation of such constraints.
Uses account for data flow through function calls (Call), object operations (Get, Set), control flow
refinement (Pred), and refinement invalidation (Havoc).
The use Call(τ
ω−→ α) corresponds to a function call with argument type τ, resulting in type
α; the effect variable ω models the effect of the target function. A constraint τ ′ ≤ Call(τ
ω−→ α)
looks up the parameter, return, and effect of τ ′ and propagates τ to the parameter, the return to α,
and the effect to ω. The uses for reading and writing to a field, Get ({f : α}) and Set ({f : τ }), are
straightforward. A constraint τ ′ ≤ Get ({f : α}) (resp. τ ′ ≤ Set ({f : τ })) looks up the field f of τ ′

and propagates the result to α (resp. τ to the result). The use Pred(P, α) is used to refine an incoming
type using predicate P, resulting in fresh type variable α. In other words, a constraint τ ≤ Pred(P, α)
will only allow the parts of τ that satisfy P to flow to α. Finally, for refinement invalidation we
introduce Havoc, which takes an environment argument Γ. A constraint x ≤ Havoc (Γ) says that
the variable x may be updated, so that any refinement involving x in Γ must be invalidated. This
will be discussed later on in greater detail (Section 3.2).

3
CONSTRAINT SYSTEM
We present the static semantics of our formal fragment by means of a constraint generating type
inference scheme. Our constraints encode type safety obligations that arise as values flow to
operations throughout the program.

3.1
Constraint Generation

The core type inference judgments for expressions and statements in FlowCore are:

Γ ⊢ e : τ; ε; ψ ⊣ Γ′ ▷ C
Γ ⊢ s : ε ⊣ Γ′ ▷ C

The derivation of a judgment relies on a set of constraints C as proof obligations, which appear on
the right of the ▷ symbol. We use ∪ for the union of two constraint sets and � for the union of
a number of constraint sets ranged over by the index in the subscript of the arguments set (e.g.,
�k
i=1 Ci). For both expressions and statements this judgment is flow-sensitive which is achieved by
introducing an output environment Γ′, in addition to the input environment Γ. The set of variable
names assigned in e or s is modeled by ε. The case of expressions has two additional byproducts: a
type τ and a predicate mapping ψ. The latter includes bindings from names to predicates that must
hold when e is truthy, and symbolic operations over them (explained later):

Fig. 4. Expression Constraint Generation in FlowCore (Variables and Functions)

Below we describe constraint generation in more detail, starting from rules handling variables,
functions, and calls (Figure 4).

Variables. The rules for reading and assigning a local variable (CG-Var and CG-Assign) involve
looking up and updating the current type for the variable in the outgoing environment. This part is
what makes this system flow-sensitive. A flow-insensitive system would use a single environment
for each judgment. The assigned type would be merged to the same type used for the variable
under update in the first place, making it less precise. In addition, reading a variable introduces a
truthy predicate on it. This is useful under specific contexts such as when the variable is used as
the condition part of an if-branch. Conversely, writing a variable forgets any refinement coming
from expression e that concerns x.

Arrow Functions. Rule CG-Fun handles arrow functions by approximating the environment at the
beginning with the flow-insensitive erasure of the current environment (since we do not know where
this function will be called). The meta-function erase computes this new environment by mapping
each x : τ α to x : αα (Figure 5). In addition, to capture the hoisting of variables defined within
the scope of the function to the beginning of the function body, we introduce the meta-function
locals that takes as argument a statement s and returns all variable identifiers xi declared in s. Each
variable xi is bound to the undefined type void (and a fresh general type αi), since its definition
is hoisted to the top of the function body and initialized to undefined. The inferred arrow type
carries the effect ε of the body of the function. Note that we are removing the formal parameter x
and local variables xi from the effect as they are only visible within the body of the defined arrow.

Calls. Rule CG-Call handles calls. We approximate the outgoing environment with a flow-
sensitive widening of the current environment (instead of pessimistically erasing everything in
scope). The meta-function widen (Figure 5) computes this new environment Γ′ by mapping each
x : τ α to x : βα where β is a fresh type variable such that τ ≤ β ≤ α. For any variable x that gets

assigned during the function call, we must fall back to its erasure, i.e., we must flow α to β. For
now this is achieved by flowing the effect ω of the call to Havoc (Γ′). The actual erasure happens
later at constraint propagation (Section 3.2), when the type of the receiver function is known and
the incoming effect is no longer abstract. As we show in Section 3.2, when a function type flows
to Call(τ2
ω−→ α), the effect ω is instantiated with the actual effect variables x carried over by the
incoming function type. These variables trigger the erasure.

Environment Operations. Before delving into the remaining typing rules, we introduce some
operations on environments (Figure 5).
Ther first one is environment join (⊔), a commutative operator that computes the least upper
bound of a pair of environments with the same domain. Type entries bound to the same symbol in
the input environments need to refer to the same program variable. This requirement allows us to
assume that the general type of a variable x bound in both environments will be the same.
The next operation we define is environment refinement (::). The semantics of a refinement ψ is
defined by how it refines environments through the constraint-producing judgment Γ :: ψ = Γ′ ▷ C,
where an environment Γ is strengthened by the predicates in ψ and result in an environment Γ′,
potentially including fresh variables that are constrained in C. When ψ is x �→ P, we update the
relevant binding in the environment Γ to a fresh type β that is the result of the predicate refinement
of the initial type τ with P (Rule Ref-Single). The rules that handle the typical logical operators
(Ref-And and Ref-Or) are straightforward.

Refinements can be invalidated by effects. In Rule Ref-Effect, we first refine Γ by ψ, and then
apply the effect ε through the “havoc” mechanism on the resulting environment Γ1. There is a slight
discrepancy in the way this mechanism is applied in this case compared to function calls, since we
only want to revert the effect of the refinement caused by ψ, and not fall back to the most general
type. If “havoc” is triggered, then for every variable x bound in Γ3, that happens to reach effect ε, we
only flow type τ (that x was bound to in Γ before the refinement) to β, instead of the most general
type α. It appears here that we are locally breaking our invariant on the form of environments,
by allowing entries with types τ in the place of the most general type summary (exponent). This
is a benign violation of our restriction on environments since the constructed environment Γ3 is
not used as the input environment in a type inference judgment, but rather as the argument to the
“havoc” use. As we will see later, this context does not produce any flows towards τ. The use of an
environment here is in fact a mere syntactic convenience.
Finally, we can have refinements with logical connectives. The negation of x �→ p is simply
x �→ ¬p. Otherwise, we push negations inward as much as possible, by applying the laws:

¬(ψ1 ∧ψ2) = ¬ψ1 ∨ ¬ψ2
¬(ψ\\ε) = ¬ψ\\ε

¬(ψ1 ∨ψ2) = ¬ψ1 ∧ ¬ψ2
¬(¬ψ) = ψ

Logical operations. The rules of Figure 6 are interesting for their effect on predicate refinement. In
Rule CG-And,e2 is analyzed under the refinementψ1 (since otherwise it would not be evaluated). The
type inferred for the entire expression contains components from both e1 and e2. From the former it
contains type α1 that is a version of τ1 refined by the falsy predicate, since it corresponds to the case
where e1 is actually falsy. From the latter it includes the type τ2 as is. For the output environment
we follow a similar strategy. The component that corresponds to e1’s output environment will be
refined with ¬ψ1, since otherwise we would be using the environment corresponding to e2. With
respect to the output predicate mapping, parts ofψ1 that apply on names written in e2 are forgotten
when taking the conjunction withψ2. Rule CG-Or is the dual of the above rule, and works similarly.
Finally, rules CG-Not and CG-Pred are straightforward. The former just negates the refinement
and the latter introduces a refinement from a runtime test p.

Fig. 8. Statement Constraint Generation in FlowCore

Records. The rules of Figure 7 for record type inference are mostly routine. During record creation
the initializer types flow to the newly constructed record literal type. Subsequent assignments of
type τ to a field f widen the type of f by introducing flows to the use Set ({f : τ }).
In practice, Flow follows a slightly stricter approach. It “fixes” the type of an object at initialization
and checks that all subsequent writes adhere to this type. This essentially amounts to checking for
type annotations which is out of scope in this section of type inference.

Statements. The main difference compared to the respective expression rule is the omission of
the assigned type and the refinement predicate. Rule CG-VarDecl reuses the rule for assignment
that we saw earlier, since due to variable hoisting, x is already in scope. Rule CG-If handles
conditional statements. This rule uses the refinement ψ for the conditional expression e to refine
the environments that are used to check each branch, with the appropriate sign in each case. The
output environment is the join of the environments at the end of each branch.

Example
We now examine how the rules of Figures 4 – 8 handle the code in lines 8 – 28 in Figure 1. In
the following we keep the produced type bindings on the left and constraint sets on the right.
Whenever, a general type (exponent) is not made explicit, this means that it’s not important for that

particular binding. Also, to avoid clutter, we do not define a new environment for each program
point, but rather introduce different versions for variables that get updated or refined.
By applying Rule CG-Rec on line 8:

nil: {kind : α1}
C ⊇ { "nil" ≤ α1 }
(1)

Here, "nil" is the string literal type denoting the exact string "nil". For the function cons (lines 9 –
11) we get

cons: (α2, α3) → O
C ⊇ { "cons" ≤ α4, α2 ≤ α5, α3 ≤ α6 }
(2)

where O � {kind : α4, head : α5, tail : α6}. We also define τcons � (α2, α3) → O. The function’s
effect is empty, so omitted here. Moving on to function sum, before checking its body we introduce
bindings for the (recursive) function itself and its parameter:

sum: α7 → τr, list: α7
(3)

We define τsum � α7 → τr . Checking the conditional in line 13, list gets a more precise type, and
is referred to as line1 inside the then-branch:

list1 : β7
C ⊇ { α7 ≤ Pred(pc, β7) }
(4)

Here, pc � ⋆.kind === "cons" is the predicate of exact equality of the field kind with the string
"cons". The uses of list in line 14 produce the following constraints (here we focus on the
interesting uses i.e., the two field accesses and the call):

C ⊇




β7 ≤ Get ({head : γ1}),
β7 ≤ Get ({tail : γ2}),
τsum ≤ Call(γ2 −→ δ1)





(5)

We omit the constraints pertinent to the return statements, since they are not crucial in this example.
The compound calls in line 18 further produce the constraints (starting from deeper nesting levels):

C ⊇ {τcons ≤ Call((number, {kind : α1}) −→ δ2) }
(6)

C ⊇ {τcons ≤ Call((number, δ2) −→ δ3) }
(7)

C ⊇ {τsum ≤ Call(δ3 −→ δ4) }
(8)

In function merge, let x1 correspond to the initial value for x and x2 to the value after the update in
line 20. Below, the first three constraints correspond to the use of the || operator and the last one
to the field access in line 21:

x1 : α8α8, x2 : α11α8
C ⊇




α8 ≤ Pred(truthy, β8),
β8 ⊔ τnil ≤ α11,
α11 ≤ Get ({kind : α10})





(9)

Finally, function havoc in lines 23–28 is similar to merge (so we won’t repeat the common parts),
but additionally, defines a function reset, that assigns null to x. Crucially, the type of x inside
reset has been erased to α8:

reset: ()
x−→ void
C ⊇ { null ≤ α8 }

For the moment, we have merely constructed a flow network, but haven’t reached any critical
conclusions. In the next section, we’ll see how we can use these facts to discover inconsistencies,
and what guarantees we get if we do not find any.

3.2
Propagation

Thinking of our system as a dataflow analysis framework, constraint generation amounts to setting
up a flow network. The next step is to allow the system to stabilize under a set of appropriate
flow functions. This latter part is called constraint propagation and corresponds to exploring all
potential data-flow paths and finding inconsistencies in them. Decomposing complex constraints
intro simpler ones is done by the rules shown in Figure 9. We say that a constraint set C is in closed
form, if it is closed with respect to these rules. In practice, we keep our constraint sets in closed
form at all times during constraint generation; that is, for every new constraint that gets generated,
we apply all eligible propagation rules until we reach a fixpoint.
If we consider the elements of C as subtyping constraints, then these rules amount to subtyping
rules. Rules CP-Trans-T and CP-Trans-E express transitivity for types and effect, respectively.
CP-Join-T and CP-Join-E decompose as usual flows from joins of elements.
Rule CP-Call decomposes the flow of an arrow type to a calling context. Note that the incoming
arrow type has a type variable α as the parameter type, since this is the form in which it is produced
by CG-Fun. Also by the CG-Call the effect and return type portion of the calling use are also
variables. Handling this flow propagates three new flows: (i) the argument’s type τ ′ flows to the
parameter type variable α, (ii) the return type τ flows to the call-site’s type β, and (iii) the function’s
effect ε flows to the call’s effect variable ω. This last byproduct often triggers the “havoc” mechanism,
which carries out the task of applying a function’s effect on the variables that are updated by it.
Rule CP-Havoc recovers soundness by restoring the conservative types for variables that are
updated through function calls (CG-Call) or are reassigned during conditional type refinement
(Ref-Effect). Lets assume the havoc operation was introduced due to the former rule. (The latter
"

case works similarly.) When CP-Havoc is triggered, our analysis has determined that variable x
gets updated in the called function, and so entries bound to x in the environment after the function
call should be conservatively approximated. Of course, this rule is only meaningful if x is bound
in that environment. Otherwise this effect can be ignored. Effectively, this corresponds to erasing
the type of the binding x : βα, by generating a flow from the flow-insensitive type α to β. This
process may happen far away from the actual call-site, which exemplifies the global character of
the type inference. An observant reader might notice that the environment argument of Havoc has
entries of the form βα. We can guarantee that this is the only possible form, by construction of the
respective flows in rules CG-Call and Ref-Effect. In both cases this happens after a widening
operation, which guarantees that the base of the environment entry is a type variable.
Rule CP-P-Base handles predicate refinement. The intuition here is that ˆτ should flow to α, if it
succeeds in the check implied by P, i.e., if check (ˆτ, P) is true. We have kept the representation of
base predicates abstract, and so we will do with the definition of check. In general, check should
be able to decide if ˆτ satisfies P by inspecting its top-level constructor (for checks like typeof ⋆
=== "string") or one of its fields.
Rule CP-P-Trans is a technical one. It allows parts of types under refinement to be concretized.
In τ ′⟨α⟩, the form τ ′⟨⟩ is a type context, i.e., a type with a “hole” that is filled in with α, for
example {f : ⟨⟩}. While rule CP-Trans-T will fail to instantiate α, CP-P-Trans allows type variables
appearing under a type constructor (e.g., the object constructor) to be instantiated. However, not
all substitutions are allowed, but only the ones where α is in a positive position with respect to
type polarity [Dolan and Mycroft 2017; Pottier 1998]2. The reason we require type variable α to
appear in a positive position is to abide by our restriction that type joins cannot appear at the
right-hand side of constraints. If we allowed the replacement of α from τ in any part of τ ′, this
could potentially break this invariant in a later propagation. We will also see the importance of this
rule in the upcoming example.
Finally, Rules CP-Get and CP-Set handling record field access and update are standard.

3.3
Consistency

The goal of running constraint generation and propagation is to eventually discover inconsistencies
in the saturated constraint set. These effectively correspond to potential bugs in the use of the
various operators, for example they could correspond to the case of a non-function value reaching
the receiver position of a call. Below we present a formal description of consistency.

Definition 3.1 (Consistency). A closed constraint set is consistent if it does not contain any
constraints in one of the forms:

• ˆτ ≤ Call(τ
ω−→ α) where ˆτ is not an arrow type (or an arrow-like type, e.g., the type of a
constructor object).

• ˆτ ≤ Set ({f : τ }) or ˆτ ≤ Get ({f : α}) where ˆτ is not an record type literal (or an object-like
type) containing f.

If our analysis finds an inconsistency, then this leads to an error report. Otherwise, if no incon-
sistency can be found then the input program enjoys the safety guarantees of Theorem 5.2.

Example

We continue where we left off in the example of Section 3.1, by applying the rules from Figure 9 on
C, in order to discover inconsistencies or prove the absence thereof.

2Section A.4 includes a formal definition of polarity and type contexts.

15

Use of predicates. We start by applying CP-Call on the calls of (5), (6), (7), (8), and the respective
function definitions:

C ⊇ {γ2 ≤ α7, τr ≤ δ1 }
(12)

C ⊇ { number ≤ α2, {kind : α1} ≤ α3, O ≤ δ2 }
(13)

C ⊇ { number ≤ α2, δ2 ≤ α3, O ≤ δ3 }
(14)

C ⊇ { δ3 ≤ α7, τr ≤ δ4 }
(15)

Now lets focus on the interesting case of handling the getters of (5). By transitivity (CP-Trans-T)
using (14), (15) and (4), the record type O flows to the predicate use:

C ⊇ { {kind : α4, head : α5, tail : α6} ≤ Pred(pc, β7) }
(16)

We use Rule CP-P-Trans on (2) and (16) to obtain:

C ⊇ { {kind : "cons", head : α5, tail : α6} ≤ Pred(pc, β7) }
(17)

This is now a successful test since the string literal type "cons" of field kind satisfies pc and so:

C ⊇ { {kind : "cons", head : α5, tail : α6} ≤ β7 }
(18)

Flow has thus discovered a path in which a “cons” object reaches the field accesses of line 14.
However, this latest constraint has enabled new flows that could cause inconsistencies, e.g., the
recursive calls to sum on the tail of list. By (18) and (5), and applying CP-Trans-T and CP-Get:

C ⊇ { α6 ≤ γ2 }
(19)

Indeed, by combining (13), (2), (19), (12) and (4) with CP-Trans-T and the result with (1) with
CP-P-Trans:

C ⊇ { {kind : "nil"} ≤ Pred(pc, β7) }
(20)

This test, however, will fail, as it would at runtime, and so the “nil” object will not reach the getter
for head or tail through α6. Without the predicate refinement filtering out “nil” objects, we would
have introduced a false positive.

Refinements and Mutation. Last, we illustrate how Flow handles functions merge and havoc. We
start by processing (11) with CP-Call and then CP-Havoc, which yields:

C ⊇ { α8 ≤ α11 }
(21)

This allows the null from the reset function to find its way to α11 from (10) and from there to the
“get” operation through (9):

C ⊇ { null ≤ Get ({kind : α10}) }
(22)

This latter constraint signals a consistency violation, keeping Flow sound with respect to variable
updates that invalidate prior refinements.

3.4
Implementation of Type Inference
A set of flow constraints C can be thought of as a constraint graph, where variables, literals and
uses are the nodes and the constraints among them are the edges. In this section, we briefly discuss
how we represent constraint graphs and compute their closure efficiently. Let us refer to type and
effect variables as “unknowns.” Following Pottier [2001], the constraint graph maps each unknown
to a set of lower bounds and a set of upper bounds, each of which contains the unknown itself.
The transitive propagation rules are specialized to exploit this structure to efficiently keep the
constraint graph in closed form.
However, equality constraints are quite inefficient in this system: they are represented as a pair
of subset constraints, which causes a cubic blowup in the transitive propagation rules. On the other
hand, equality constraints are quite useful and common in Flow. They arise due to invariant typing
of object properties, array elements, and type arguments of polymorphic classes. They directly
model equations expressed by type aliasing. Finally, even though we formalize CP-Havoc with a
constraint of the form α ≤ β, we can replace it without loss of generality with α = β.
To address the inefficiency, we generalize the constraint graph by considering each unknown
to be in an equivalence class containing other unknowns it is unified with, and mapping each
equivalence class to either “unresolved” bounds (like Pottier [2001]), or to a “resolved” type or effect
(as in unification). The transitive propagation rules generalize in a straightforward way. Overall,
this simple optimization leads to O(n) reduction in space and time complexity.

4
RUNTIME SEMANTICS
Before we describe our safety result (Section 5) we present the runtime semantics for the formal
fragment of Section 2, which is heavily based on that used by Rastogi et al. [2015] that cover a
subset of JavaScript, emphasizing on features of interest, while abstracting away non-crucial ones.

4.1
Definitions

Figure 10 contains the definitions for runtime configurations in FlowCore.

Runtime Values. To account for heap-allocated values, we introduce locations ℓ that index runtime
heaps. Together with constants they synthesize runtime values, which are normal form as far as
execution is concerned. Locations are also added to the set of expressions in our runtime language
along with all other expression forms introduced earlier.

"Fast and Precise Type Checking for JavaScript
17

Runtime State. There are three constituent parts that compose a runtime state S. The first part
is the heap H, which includes bindings from locations to heap values �v, which in turn are either
values, closures, or heap objects. A closure is a pair containing a store L that binds all external
variables available at the point of definition of the arrow function (capture by reference), and the
function’s code, which is a statement succeeded by a returned expression. The second part of the
runtime state is the stack X, that contains a list of stack frames. Each stack frame includes a store
containing the variables bound in the stack frame at the time execution left that frame, and an
evaluation context E that holds the context that execution would jump into when returning to
that stack frame. Evaluation contexts are defined in the usual way having the same structure as
expressions or statements but with a hole ⟨ ⟩ at the position of the term that is about to be evaluated
next. Finally, the runtime state includes a store L, that comprises bindings of variable names to
locations to allow closures to capture values by reference.

Runtime Configurations. We write our runtime configurations S (i.e., programs under execution)
as pairs that contain a runtime state S, and a language term, which can either be an expression e, a
statement s, or a function body {s; return e}. We conflate the notions of expressions and function
bodies into a common notion using the symbol M, for compactness in stating our results.

4.2
Reduction Rules
Figure 11 contain a small-step operational semantics for programs in FlowCore. The rules can
have the forms: S; e −→ S′; e′ and S; s −→ S′; s′.
Next we describe some of the most interesting rules. Rule RT-Var shows the indirection in
dereferencing variables. First the store L is looked up and then the resulting location is used
to access the heap H. Similarly variable assignments have to go through the same process in
Rule RT-Asgn. Here, symbol ◁ denotes the update of state S with the new heap H′.
When evaluating arrows, the current store S.L is saved as part of the created closure, along with
the code M of the function (Rule RT-Arr). This store is restored when the function is called (Rule RT-
Call). The new store L′ that will be used in the new stack frame also includes a binding for the
function parameter x and bindings from all variables xi defined in the body M, since their definition
is hoisted to the top of the function scope. We use metavariable locals to extract these variables. All
new variables are bound to fresh locations ℓi. Locals have not been initialized yet, so their locations
are bound to undefined in the heap H′. Finally, a new stack frame L.E is pushed on the existing
stack X as we enter the new function context. After returning from this function, execution will
return to E (Rule RT-Ret). The rest of the expression reduction rules are routine.

5
METATHEORY

In order to prove type safety for our type system we first introduce a declarative type system that
closely matches the intuition of the type inference system described in Section 3. Based on the
declarative system we then formulate a type safety argument for the above language fragment via
a progress and a preservation theorem [Wright and Felleisen 1994], that connect type checking
with the runtime semantics of Section 4. Essentially, we establish the fact that if a program has
been checked with the above algorithm and has been found consistent, then its execution will not
lead to uncaught type errors (e.g., “undefined is not a function”). Introducing this intermediate step
in our metatheory is not mandatory, but it vastly reduces the complexity of reasoning about type
safety, compared to the inference version of Section 3.

5.1
Declarative Type System
This system assigns concrete types, i.e., types stripped off of type variables, to language terms
of FlowCore. Environments Γ also map program variables to concrete type entries (where both
flow-sensitive and flow-insensitive types are concrete). The same holds for effects ε. The typing
judgments for expressions and statements are: Γ ⊩ e : τ; ε; ψ

⊩

Γ′ and Γ ⊩ s : ε

Γ′. The
respective rules for these judgments follow the main intuitions of the inference system and are
therefore deferred to Section B, along with other attendant definitions.
A substitution ρ maps type variables of the inference system to concrete types of the declarative
system, and can be extended to types, effects and environments in a point-wise manner. Constraints
c in the inference system correspond to subtyping relations in the concrete system for both types
and effects. We can use the same substitution ρ to convert a constraintc to one or multiple subtyping
constraints over concrete types or effects. Since our type language has been kept simple overall,

the subtyping rules for concrete types are routine and so a discussion is deferred to the appendix.
We say that a substitution ρ satisfies a constraint set C if all subtyping constraints generated by
mapping ρ over C are valid. In this case we write ρ ⊢ C.
We argue about the soundness of our type inference system with respect to the declarative
system with the following lemma.

Lemma 5.1 (Soundness of Type Inference). If Γ ⊢ e : τ; ε; ψ ⊣ Γ′ ▷C and there exists substitution
ρ s.t. ρ ⊢ C, then ρ (Γ) ⊩ e : ρ (τ) ; ρ (ε) ; ψ

ρ (Γ′).

5.2
Type Safety
Before we state our type safety result for the declarative system, we extend the type checking
judgment to runtime configurations: G ⊩Σ S; e : τ. Here G is a flow-insensitive environment
mapping variables to their most general concrete type throughout the program. The judgment
is to be read as: under a heap typing Σ, mapping heap locations to types and a flow-insensitive
environment G, a configuration S; e is a assigned a type τ. We can now state our type safety result.

Theorem 5.2 (Type Safety). For a configuration S; e and heap typing Σ, if G ⊩Σ S; e : τ, then:

• (Preservation) If S; e −→ S′; e′, then there exists Σ′, such that G ⊩Σ′ S′; e′: τ ′.
• (Progress) Either e is a value, or there exists a configuration S′; e′ such that S; e −→ S′; e′.

Supporting lemmas and proofs for the above results can be found in the appendix.

TYPE ANNOTATIONS
So far, we have described a system for type inference that ensures that values are used in ways
that are consistent with their definitions. But can we check that the inferred types of values are
consistent with types we specify?
In this section, we introduce a system for type checking. Type annotations τ follow a similar
grammar as types except that there are no type variables, types can appear anywhere type variables
could appear, and there are no effects. We consider a type annotation to be just another kind of
type use, that expects some type of values. In other words, like everything else we can formulate
type checking with flow constraints.
Technically, we need some new propagation rules for flow constraints involving type annotations.
When we see a constraint of the form L ≤ {f1 : τ1, . . . , fn : τn}, we propagate it with new
constraints L ≤ Get ({f1 : α1}), α1 ≤ τ1, L ≤ Set ({f1 : τ1}), ..., L ≤ Get ({fn : αn}), αn ≤ τn,
L ≤ Set ({fn : τn}). (As mentioned Section 3.1, when L is a record type, these flow constraints can
be replaced by unification constraints as an optimization.)
The remaining propagation rules rely on some new definitions.

Escaping effects. Since a function type annotation has nothing to do with any particular function
expression, we cannot calculate its effect in the usual manner. Instead, we assume that there is an
effect variable ω⋆ that captures “escaping” effects, and that all function type annotations have this
effect. When we see a constraint of the form L ≤ τ1 −→ τ2, we propagate it with the new constraints

L ≤ Call(τ1
ω⋆
−−→ α2) and α2 ≤ τ2.

Conditional flow constraints. Checking that an inferred type is consistent with a union type
annotation is tricky. Intuitively, this amounts to checking that the inferred type is consistent with
either case of the union type annotation. But since the inferred type may contain type variables, it
may not be obvious which case to pick. Consider the code in Figure 12 (left), where the parameter
f on line 33 has a type that is the union of two function types. The call on line 33 is safe, since both
function types take string. However, it is unclear which choice of function type to use for id on

line 35. Picking IDString seems fine “locally,” but turns out to be the wrong choice since null is
passed on the next line and picking IDNullableString instead would type check.
Alternatively, we could propagate the choice further, effectively introducing disjunction in the
logic of flow constraints. While appealing from a theoretical perspective, in practice this approach is
complicated to implement and difficult to scale. It also doesn’t mesh well with refinements. Consider
the code in Figure 12 (right). Here, we propagate the choice of type for the object argument on
line 45 into the fields of the object types in the union Correlated; this causes the call to type check,
since the type and val fields of the object separately typecheck against the corresponding unions.
However, this is unsound, as the call on line 43 shows (it passes a number at run time where a
string is expected).
Instead, our approach is to try picking a case without ambiguity (i.e., without considering type
variables), or demand further type annotations to disambiguate. Specifically, let any constraint of
the form α ≤ ⋆ or ⋆ ≤ α be a condition: its validity is conditional on what type α is inferred to
be. Suppose that we have a restricted form of constraint propagation without the transitivity rule
CP-Trans-T, so that conditions are not propagated. The propagation rule for choice, described
below, uses this restricted form of constraint propagation to generate a set of constraints. If the rule
signals an ambiguity, then the developer must provide annotations for the type variables involved
in any generated conditions. Otherwise, the generated conditions are propagated further using the
unrestricted rules.
A constraint of the form L ≤ τ1 ⊔ τ2 is propagated as follows:

• Either L ≤ τ1 generates an inconsistent set of constraints; then we continue with L ≤ τ2.
• Or L ≤ τ1 generates a consistent set of constraints c1.

– Either L ≤ τ2 generates an inconsistent set of constraints; then we continue with c1.
– Or L ≤ τ2 generates a consistent set of constraints c2.

∗ Either c1 ⊆ c2; then we continue with c1.
∗ Or c1 ⊈ c2; then we signal an ambiguity.

MODULES AND DEPENDENCIES

Until now, we have presented Flow’s analysis on “whole” programs. However, JavaScript codebases
can be quite large (e.g., at Facebook we have millions of lines of JavaScript code), and a whole-
program set-based analysis is simply not fast enough at scale.
In this section, we show how we modularize Flow’s analysis. Modularization is important for
performance, in terms of both time and space. It is also a natural fit for modern JavaScript, where
code is typically split across a (large) number of (small) files; every file is mapped to a module,
and possibly imports other modules; definitions are local by default, unless they are exported; and
accessing global definitions other than builtins is generally discouraged.
"
`;

exports[`getPageText with large file Page [21 / 58] - should get the page text 1`] = `
"Fast and Precise Type Checking for JavaScript
21

Broadly, we follow the standard approach of analyzing each file separately, once all files it
depends on have been analyzed. This strategy allows us to incrementally analyze the program as
files change (Section 8), and parallelize the analysis across files (Section 9).
The key idea is to demand a “signature” for every module. We ensure that types inferred for
the expressions a module exports do not contain type variables—wherever they do, we demand
type annotations. For example, the parameter of an exported function expression must specify
its type. Otherwise, we risk having the type of the parameter depend on calls in other files that
import this module, which breaks modularization. (Alternatively, we could try generalizing the
parameter’s type based on how it is used inside the function expression, but in our experience it
leads to unwieldy types.)
Requiring annotations for module interfaces is much better than requiring per-function annota-
tions: a typical module exports one object or function, while having a bunch of module-internal code.
The minimum annotation burden is only a small fraction of lines of code. (Of course, annotations
are permissible even where they are not required.)
The type annotation syntax is designed to be nearly as expressive as the internal type language,
but it is not true that all well-typed code can be cleanly refactored into modules to preserve typing.
This is by design: modules are abstractions, and so some rewriting might be needed to prevent
leaking abstractions. For example, effects do not appear in types at all, and local effects that leak
after refactoring would need rewriting.
Independently, having a signature for every module turns out to be a desirable choice for software
engineering. It is considered good practice for documentation (files that import the module can
simply look up its signature instead of its implementation), as well as error localization (blames for
errors do not cross module boundaries).

Modules, exports, and imports. For the purposes of this paper, let us assume that every file maps
to a module by the same name. (This is sufficient to model the popular CommonJS module system,
which is the default module system in Flow. However, we also support module systems where
module names are independent of file names and not necessarily in 1-1 correspondence.)
A file can import definitions that another file exports. However, the reference m to the exporting
file inside the importing file is relative to the importing file.

Module loading and dependency tracking. We assume a module loading judgment FS ⊩ Fi ::
m � F ?
e that, given a file name Fi and a reference m, either computes the name Fe of the file being
referenced by m in Fi or errors, while recording any files looked up by the derivation in FS (which
may or may not exist). Whenever FS ⊩ Fi :: m � Fe, we assume Fe exists and have Fe in FS.
Given a file system state that satisfies the constraints FS, we say that Fi depends on Fe whenever
FS ⊩ Fi :: m � Fe.

Compilation and linking. Files are “compiled” and “linked” in dependency order. In practice,
there may be cycles in the dependency graph, so this process is run on the directed acyclic graph
of strongly connected components, where each strongly connected component is considered to
have all the imports and exports of the files in it. For each file, compilation and linking generates
exported types and signature constraints of the form ˆτ ≤ α, where any type variables in ˆτ are in
positive positions. Such signature constraints fully describe the types of exports of the file, which
can be “substituted” for the types of corresponding imports in dependent files.
Suppose that compiling a file F, with module references typed as fresh type variables α1, . . . ,αn,
generates constraints c and an exported type τ. Furthermore, suppose that the module references
resolve to files F1, . . . , Fn that have their signature constraints c⋆
1 , . . . ,c⋆
n and exported types
τ1, . . . ,τn.
"
`;

exports[`getPageText with large file Page [22 / 58] - should get the page text 1`] = `
"22
Avik Chaudhuri, Panagiotis Vekris, Sam Goldman, Marshall Roch, and Gabriel Levi

Then, we link F by adding c⋆
1 , . . . ,c⋆
n to c, propagating the constraints τ1 ≤ α1, . . . ,τn ≤ αn, and
transforming c to c⋆ by the process signature(τ), defined recursively as follows:

(1) signature(α) throws away upper bounds of α, and calls signature(ˆτ) for each ˆτ ≤ α.
(2) signature(ˆτ) demands a type annotation for each type variable in a negative position in ˆτ,
and calls signature(α) for each α in a positive position in ˆτ.

Intuitively, this process walks over constraints, with the exported types as roots, while doing
two things. One, any constraints that would be unreachable when the exported types flow to type
uses in dependent files are pruned away. Two, the developer must provide annotations wherever
constraints could propagate back from dependent files.
Formally, a key property of signature constraints c⋆ and exported types τ is that it is impossible
for a constraint of the form τ ≤ u to lead to, via propagation, a constraint of the form ˆτ ≤ α where α
is in c⋆. In other words, signature constraints and exported types can be considered “closed” when
linking dependent files. This means that they do not need to be recomputed for correctness—in
fact, they can be memoized and reused—which is crucial for performance. This also means that
whenever “diamonds” occur in the dependency graph, i.e., F depends on another file via multiple
paths, the signature constraints of F are the same no matter which order the paths are explored.

8
INCREMENTALIZATION

In this section, we show how Flow exploits modularity and dependency management to incremen-
tally analyze files as they change.

Architecture. Flow’s architecture consists of a server, a client, and a file system watcher. The
server initially analyzes the entire codebase, following the procedure in the previous section, and
stores a bunch of information in memory. The information not only includes the status (type errors),
but also the results of separately compiling and linking every file, and the dependencies between
files. Once the server is initialized, it runs in the background.
The client queries the server for information, relaying commands issued via the command-line
or various IDEs. Typically, the client is interested in the status. But the client could also ask for the
type at a particular position, the definitions reaching a particular reference, etc., in which case the
server computes that information almost instantaneously from the information already stored in
memory.
Finally, the file system watcher informs the server of changes to the file system: which files have
been added, modified, or deleted. Based on this information, the server re-analyzes a (hopefully
small) fraction of the code base, and updates the information stored in memory. (When the client
queries the server again, the response is based on this updated information.)

Incremental analysis. Files that are added or modified need to be re-analyzed. In addition, a subset
of unmodified “dependent” files needs to be re-analyzed. This set can be partitioned into direct
dependents and indirect dependents.
Direct dependents are computed as follows. For any file F that is added, modified, or deleted,
whenever F is in FS for any unmodified Fi where FS ⊩ Fi :: m � F ?
e, we consider Fi is a direct
dependent. The depends relation is modified by re-resolving module references in direct dependents.
Indirect dependents are unmodified files that recursively depend on direct dependents.

PARALLELIZATION

We use a map/reduce algorithm augmented with shared memory communication for parallelizing
various stages of type checking, building on and extending Hack’s model [Hack 2014].

9.1
Workers

Assume we want to distribute a task on a number of files, computing a result of type R. We describe
the task with a function job : Files → W ; a function merge : R ×W → R; a value neutral : R; and
a function next : () → Files.
We have a master process and as many worker processes as the number of available processors.
The master initially has result as neutral, and considers all workers free. Then, it repeatedly does
the following:

• If there is a free worker, call next() to obtain a list of files files. If files is empty and all workers
are free, exit with result result. If files is not empty, send it to the free worker.

• If a worker has sent back w, consider the worker free, run merge(result, w) and update result
with it.

Correspondingly, every worker repeatedly does the following. If the master has sent files, fork a
process to run job(files), wait for a value w, and send back w to the master.
Usually, the next function is simple. It just remembers an index into the original list of files.
When the index is out of bounds, it returns an empty list; otherwise it returns a sublist from that
index of some fixed “bucket” size, and advances the index. This models processing a static list of
files in no particular order.
What if the processed list is computed dynamically, in a particular order? For that, we make
the following changes. We maintain a “worklist” of files, and have next create a bucket from
the worklist instead. Let the intermediate result type W ′ be Files × W . Then job′(files) returns
(files, job(files)). Finally, merge′(result, (files, w)) updates the worklist with files, before returning
merge(result, w).

9.2
Shared Heap

As described above, the master and the workers communicate by serializing and deserializing data
like files and intermediate results. In practice, the results that need to be computed are often maps
from files to large values, and thus communicating intermediate results from the workers back
to the master becomes a performance bottleneck. Furthermore, manipulating large results in the
master spikes its memory usage and causes frequent garbage collection pauses, which affects the
server’s responsiveness.
Thus, we use a different mechanism for sharing results: a large hashtable mapped to RAM,
accessible to both the master and the workers, that is logically divided into various maps. The
hashtable provides fast (lock-free) concurrent access for reads, as well as for writes as long as they
add entries for disjoint keys. Only the master can remove entries. These conditions turn out to be
easily satisfied in our setting: at any stage of type checking, different workers always operate on
different files, and old entries are only ever cleared to make way for new entries when processing
file system changes in the master.
Entries are compressed on writes. (We use LZ4 [Collet 2011] because it is extremely fast, while
providing sufficient compression.) In practice, this means we can tolerate redundancy in the entries,
trading off space for time by precomputing information. Moreover, entries are cached on reads.
With the shared heap, the types R andW can be quite small (typically, metadata for bookkeeping).
Moreover, the processes forked by workers to run jobs are short-lived: their memory is reclaimed
by killing them on every completion.

9.3
Parallelizing Parsing

Files are parsed in parallel, in no particular order, using a static next. Every job writes the abstract
syntax trees for corresponding files to shared memory.

9.4
Parallelizing Compilation and Linking
Next, the files are compiled and linked in parallel, following dependency order, using a dynamic
next. We maintain a count of dependencies for each file. The worklist initially contains files that
do not depend on any other files. As files are processed, they decrement the dependency counts of
other files that depend on them, possibly causing those files to be added to the worklist (because
they no longer depend on any files that have not already been processed).
Every job reads the abstract syntax trees for the corresponding files, and the signature flow
constraints for the files they depend on, does compilation and linking, and finally writes the
signature flow constraints for the corresponding files to shared memory.
Note that a file does not need to be rechecked if the signature flow constraints for none of its
dependencies change. This is a major optimization: it means that even though a file may have a lot
of recursive dependents, only a small fraction of them may actually need to be rechecked. Indeed,
in practice it results in order-of-magnitude differences in recheck times. The implementation is
slightly tricky because new signature flow constraints often contain fresh type variables that make
them trivially different than old signature flow constraints. We compute and compare hashes
modulo such trivial differences to detect when signature flow constraints have changed.
Compiling and linking files in dependency order limits some parallelism in theory, but in practice,
the alternative approach of processing every file independently ends up doing far more work.
Overall we save processing time by an order of magnitude.

EXPERIMENTS

We ran experiments on the main internal repository at Facebook, in which (at the time of writing
this paper) around 13M LOC of JavaScript are covered by Flow, spanning around 122K files. We
chose this repository because it contains a wide variety of JavaScript projects, implementing client
code and frameworks for web applications, that depend on each other but are owned by different
teams and do not necessarily conform to a uniform coding style. (A smaller repository contains
client code and frameworks for mobile applications, which is also covered by Flow, but which we
do not consider here—the general conclusions about Flow’s behavior, however, remain the same.)

Distribution of annotations. For each file, we counted the number of annotations as a fraction of
the total number of locations that could potentially be annotated. Figure 13 shows the distribution
of these relative numbers across the repository. The median is 29% annotations. In aggregate, there
are around 686K annotations vs. 1502K other locations that could potentially be annotated but
"
`;

exports[`getPageText with large file Page [25 / 58] - should get the page text 1`] = `

25

are not. Note that these numbers do not account for type inference of every expression—only
declaration sites are considered—and thus conservatively overapproximate the annotation burden.

Usage of refinements. As a quick test of the impact of supporting refinements in Flow, turning it
off led to more than 145K spurious errors across this repository.

Effects of parallelization on performance. Total initialization time was around 225s with 32 pro-
cessors (Xeon, 2.2GHz), which means around 3 ms per file on average. We also used around 4GB of
shared memory.
Figure 14 shows how performance varies with the number of processors (we only measured
performance for powers-of-2 processors and extrapolated). Parsing times become half from 2
to 4 processors, but then the improvements slow down (since parsing is already quite fast, and
communication starts dominating—an example of Amdahl’s law). Compilation and linking times
hit the limit much later, continuing to improve almost linearly until 16 processors. (This makes
sense, since compiling and linking is much slower than parsing.)

Effects of code size on performance. The time taken to compile and link a file grows approximately
linearly with code size. While set-based analysis is well-known to be worst-case cubic in code
size, the lines of code per file is small (average 106), and the imports are summarized by signature
constraints, which are much smaller than the corresponding lines of code of dependencies.

Effects of dependencies on performance. The time taken to process a file is not correlated with
the number of recursive dependencies—the spread of times remains relatively flat as dependencies
grow. This is not very surprising, since signature constraints of imports are supposed to “compress”
the information contained in recursive dependencies. On the other hand, the time taken to process
a file grows approximately linearly with the number of imports.
The size of the signature constraint graph, which form the results of compiling and linking, is
not correlated with code size—for most files, the sizes are between 50-100KB.

Effects of incrementalization on performance. The performance of incremental type checking is
tied to the number of files that are rechecked when a file is modified, i.e., the number of files that
recursively depend on that file.
The distribution of the number of recursive dependents is highly positively skewed—the median
is less than 10, and the 90th percentile is less than 100. Considering the time taken to recheck to
be roughly proportional to the number of files to link, this means that in 90% of cases, recheck
time is less than 200ms plus some constant. Of course this is only a rough calculation: in practice,
while this closely approximates the common scenario of editing single files, it doesn’t account for
occasional rebases that can cause larger numbers of files to be rechecked.

RELATED WORK
There has been a lot of work on type systems for JavaScript and related languages, as well as
set-based inference techniques. We focus here only on the most closely related work.

11.1
Mainstream Type Systems for Dynamic Languages

TypeScript [2012] is a widely used typed superset of JavaScript. Like Flow, it aims to improve
developer productivity by providing tooltips through IDEs. Unlike Flow, it focuses only on finding
“likely errors” without caring about soundness [Bierman et al. 2014]. Type inference in TypeScript is
mostly local and in some cases contextual; it doesn’t perform global type inference like Flow, so in
general more annotations are needed. Whenever type annotations are missing, they are considered
"
`;

exports[`getPageText with large file Page [26 / 58] - should get the page text 1`] = `
"26

to be any (instead of being implicitly inferred). Thus, many type errors are missed. Consider for
example the program:

function square(n) { return n * n; }
square("oops");
Flow will signal an error for trying to use a string as an argument to a multiplication. TypeScript,
on the other hand, will infer any as the type for n and accept this program as valid. To get a similar
behavior from TypeScript we would need to add a type annotation to the parameter n of square.
Furthermore, even with fully annotated programs, TypeScript misses type errors because of
unsound typing rules. For example, “bivariant” subtyping means that functions and instances of
polymorphic classes can be passed to contexts that do not preserve their typing invariants, as can
be seen in the following erroneous example:

var assertString = (x: string) => assert(typeof x === "string");
var app = (f: (x: string | number) => void, x: number) => f(x);
app(assertString, 1);
A checker that implements sound contra-variant argument subtyping, like Flow, would signal an
error at the call to app, since assertString is incompatible in its argument with the expected type
for parameter f of app. In practice, this means that TypeScript developers have to code defensively
with dynamic checks, even when types are included. Safe TypeScript [Rastogi et al. 2015] “fixes”
soundness problems in TypeScript with stricter typing rules and runtime enforcement mechanisms
to restore gradual typing.

Dart [2011] is another language that shares the same philosophy. Unsoundness is a deliberate
choice in TypeScript and Dart, motivated by the desire to balance convenience with bug-finding.
But we have enough anecdotal evidence from developers at Facebook that focusing on soundness
is not only useful but also desirable, and does not necessarily imply inconvenience. Similar to Safe
TypeScript, recent work recovers soundness in Dart [Heinze et al. 2016].

Closure [2009] is another widely used type system for JavaScript that focuses on transforming
code for size reduction. As far as we can tell, it is sound modulo similar assumptions as Flow,
but lacks type inference. Typed Racket [Tobin-Hochstadt and Felleisen 2008], and Hack [2014]
(for PHP) are also quite close in spirit: their optional typing is at the level of modules and they
use occurrence typing to perform similar kinds of refinements. They differ in that they lack type
inference and, compared to Flow, their treatment of mutable variables is far more simplistic—there
is no distinction between mutability on the stack and on the heap. On the other hand, Flow heavily
borrows from Hack’s design and implementation for scaling to millions of lines of code.

Early work. Several static typing systems have successfully been ported to the dynamic setting of
JavaScript. Early work by Thiemann [2005] and Anderson et al. [2005] focus on restricted subsets
of the language.

Type Refinement. In the area of type refinement, Guha et al. [2011] develop flow typing, which,
like Flow, supports type narrowing as a consequence of control flow. Unlike Flow, their analysis
is strictly intra-procedural, does not perform type inference and does not track non-local effects
(e.g., variable updates). Building on this work, Lerner et al. [2013] present a framework for building
type systems for JavaScript, engineered modularly to encourage experimentation, but which also
suffers from limited type inference compared to Flow.

Static Objects. Choi et al. [2015] propose a static type system for ahead-of-time compilation of
JavaScript that guarantees fixed object layout. Its type inference is based on very similar foundations
as Flow. SJS focuses mainly on taming legacy object-oriented features (constructor functions,

27

open methods, and prototype inheritance). While Flow does support these features, its model
and guarantees are different—it models these features with extensible objects, and guarantees
type consistency of gets and sets of properties (but necessarily their existence). Many of these
concepts are replaced by classes in “modern” (ES6+) JavaScript, where Flow can provide stronger
guarantees with advanced type system features like bounded polymorphism, this types, and
read-only properties. Chandra et al. [2016] build on this work by adding support for abstract objects,
first-class methods, and recursive objects, and prove their extensions sound. Their type system
supports additional features such as polymorphic arrays, operator overloading, and intersection
types in manually-written interface descriptors for library code, that they found important for
building GUI applications. Their formalization focuses on their object model. Unlike Flow, they do
not discuss type refinement based on conditional checks, and their formalization is flow-insensitive,
so less precise in that respect compared to Flow.

Abstract Interpretation. This is a more heavyweight approach in statically analyzing JavaScript.
Approaches here include TAJS [Andreasen and Møller 2014; Jensen et al. 2011, 2009, 2010], JSAI [Ka-
shyap et al. 2014] and SAFE [Lee et al. 2012; Park and Ryu 2015]. These approaches vary in precision,
user customizability and flow-, context- and path-sensitivity, but being whole-program analyses,
they are out of scope at our scale, while being much more precise and not needing annotations.

Program Logics. Recent advances in SMT solver technology has spurred the interest in using
program logics to track the dynamic behavior of JavaScript programs. DJS [Chugh et al. 2012]
combines nested refinements with alias types [Smith et al. 2000], a restricted separation logic, to
account for aliasing and flow-sensitive heap updates to obtain a static type system for a large
portion of JavaScript. DJS comes with very limited type inference and hence requires complex
annotations at function and loop boundaries. To reduce this annotation burden, Vekris et al. [2016]
offer refinement type inference for TypeScript, based on Liquid Type inference [Rondon et al. 2008].
Their type system is more expressive than Flow’s as it allows logical predicates (taken from a
number of decidable logics) to be attached on a base type system (a subset of TypeScript’s type
system). However, this precision comes at the cost of a higher annotation burden and a penalty on
scalability. Also, while offering global refinement type inference, unlike Flow it does not infer the
base (underlying) types of programs and requires explicit immutability annotations.

11.3
Inference and Subtyping in Dynamic Languages

Constrained Types. Set constraints have been used for the purpose of type inference by Aiken and
Wimmers [1992] and Aiken et al. [1994], who adopt the set-theoretic model to infer types in a simple
functional language. Trifonov and Smith [1996] and Pottier [1998] infer polymorphic recursively
constrained types, but retain a simpler interpretation of type terms. In their work, ground types
are regular terms, and subtyping is defined explicitly on terms. This enables various simplifications
to their constraint sets, like garbage collection [Eifrig et al. 1995; Pottier 1998, 2001]. Flanagan and
Felleisen [1999] use a simpler type representation and, based on simplification algorithms that
exploit the observable equivalence of constraint sets, perform componential set-based analysis.
Flow builds directly on work by Pottier [2001], but does not infer polymorphic types. Instead, it
exposes features less frequently addressed in the context of set-constraint based analyses, such as
variable updates and type refinement based on conditional checks. In addition, Flow’s analysis is
not context-sensitive, due in part to anecdotal concerns about performance in DoctorJS [Vardoulakis
2012]. In practice, polymorphic type annotations recover context-sensitivity where needed.

Constraint Graph Simplification. The research directions above already include several simplifi-
cation techniques [Fähndrich and Aiken 1996; Flanagan 1997]. To further improve performance of

inclusion constraint analyses, Fähndrich et al. [1998] propose a technique for eliminating cycles in
constraint graphs that is based on a non-standard graph representation called inductive form, and
only traverses part of the paths during the search for cycles. To address the problem of redundant
paths in a constraint graph, Su et al. [2000] propose projection merging, a technique intended to
be used in conjunction with the above. In contrast, we directly implement unification constraints
using union-find over a base representation of inclusion constraints.

Semantic and Algebraic Subtyping. Advances in semantic and algebraic foundations have spurred
renewed interest in this rich area. Semantic subtyping has been proposed in the context of functional
languages for XML based programming [Frisch et al. 2008], ML-like languages [Castagna et al. 2016],
and more recently for imperative object-oriented languages, where fields can be mutable [Ancona
and Corradi 2016], and in a gradual typing setting [Castagna and Lanvin 2017]. Even though
polymorphic type inference with subtyping is known to be undecidable [Su et al. 2002], Dolan
and Mycroft [2017] infer compact principal types by keeping a strict separation between the types
used to describe inputs and those used to describe outputs (polarities). In comparison, Flow is less
ambitious with union and intersection types.

12
LIMITATIONS AND THREATS TO VALIDITY

We conclude this paper by discussing limitations and threats to validity.
Flow’s analysis is cubic in the worst case. Although pathological examples are not entirely
uncommon, we have so far been able to mitigate them with low-hanging optimizations.
Its analysis is context-insensitive, and also not well-suited for libraries with reflection. Many
libraries provide annotations without checked implementations, so we can typecheck the vast
majority of code that uses these libraries. Better techniques for checking libraries (e.g., TAJS) can
complement Flow.
Like many other type systems for dynamically typed languages, Flow has the any type, with
which type checking can be completely bypassed. Unlike gradual type systems, though, there is no
runtime enforcement of types when they interact with any. For sound gradual typing, the subtyping
rules can be augmented to mark all type constructors as either trusted or untrusted.
Even without any, some aspects of JavaScript force us into choosing unsoundness where it is
objectively justified. We can lay down the conditions for soundness, but not enforce them. For
example, arrays in JavaScript can have “holes”: it is possible to add an element out of bounds, in
which case any intermediate positions are filled with undefined. Likewise, records in JavaScript
can also be accessed as dictionaries, so it is possible to read and write a named property by passing
a computed string. Short of complicated numeric and string analysis, soundness would demand
that we lose type information on array dereferences and dictionary reads, but this is too restrictive
in practice. Instead we hope that developers who care about soundness will not create arrays
with holes (e.g., by always using Array.push to add elements), or will check for undefined on
dereferences when needed; and the properties that are named and those that are accessed via
computed strings are disjoint.

Appendices

These appendices contain material that was omitted from the main paper. All definitions that are
included in the main paper also hold here. In addition we introduce ground types (the model upon
which our types are based), substitutions and subtyping, as well as a brief note on polarities that
were mentioned in the main paper. We also include typing for our language’s runtime, and proofs
of soundness of the inference of our system with respect to the declarative system introduced in
the main paper and the type safety of the declarative system.

A
TYPES

In this section we include a discussion on ground types which is the model that the types described
in Section 2 are based on. We then provide some more context on the notion of polarity that was
alluded to during the discussion about constraint propagation (Section 3.2). Finally, we define
notions related to type subsumption as they are going to be useful for the statement of lemmas and
theorems moving forward.

A.1
Ground Types
At the basis of the type language described in Section 2.2 is the notion of ground types. The
formulation of our ground type language follows the one presented by Pottier [1998]. Here we will
focus on the changes we made to adapt that formulation to our system’s needs. Ground types in
our system are regular trees. The formal definition is similar to Pottier [1998, Definition 1.1] but
our ground signature Σд contains the terminals b and → for types and the terminals ⊥ and the
set of program variables X for effects. Also → has arity 3 to also account for the function’s effect,
whose position is co-variant.

Ground Substitutions. We connect the notion of types that were introduced in Section 2.2 with
ground types using the notion of ground substitutions ρ.

Definition A.1 (Ground Substitution). A ground substitution ρ (we will also refer to it as solution)

is a total mapping from type variables to ground types.

A ground substitution can be applied to types by recursively applying the substitution to the
parts of the type, replacing type variables with their ground type mapping.
As regular trees, ground types can be infinite structures, whereas the types we introduced in the
main part are finite, but crucially include type variables. This means that a finite, yet recursively
defined, type may correspond (through a substitution) to an infinite ground type.

A.2
Ground Subtyping

Because of their infinite nature defining a subtyping relation on ground types requires some special
treatment. Here, we define an ordering on ground types by quantifying over paths in the regular
trees that represent types. The symbol ≤k denotes subtyping up to level k. The definition is similar
to Pottier [1998, Definition 1.5]. For the case of effects, ≤0 is reflexive and ⊥ is the minimum element.
The definition of the subtyping relation ≤ over ground types follows Pottier [1998, Definition 1.4]
and as in Pottier [1998, Proposition 1.3], τ ≤ τ ′ is equivalent to:

∀k ≥ 0 .τ ≤k τ ′

Equipping our ground alphabet with ⊥ and ⊤ for types, and ⊤ for effects (we have omitted them
from our formulation to avoid clutter), and using the subtyping relation, our ground types can form
a lattice. The proof follows Pottier [1998, Proposition 1.3].

Effects. The subtyping relation is extended to ground effects as well (we also refer to them as
concrete effects). Concrete effects can be interpreted as sets of variables and so effect subtyping
corresponds to the subset relation.

Environments. In the following we assume that applying a substitution ρ to an environment Γ of
the constraint generation system returns a pair containing two environments:

• a concrete flow-sensitive environment ∆ binding variables to ground types in a flow-sensitive
manner (i.e. types that correspond to the base of the entries in Γ), and

• a general environment G binding variables to ground types corresponding to the general type
of each entry in Γ.

We write this as:
ρ (Γ) = ∆; G

We also use indexes as subscripts to retrieve the first or second part of the above pair:

ρ (Γ)1 = ∆
ρ (Γ)2 = G

The subtyping relation is extended to ∆ and G in a point-wise manner.
Note that this is different that the notation we used in the main paper where we kept type entries
of the form τ τ ′. We made this change with the hope that it removes unnecessary clutter from our
formalization.

A.3
Constraint Satisfaction

The following definitions relate ground substitutions with constraint sets.

Definition A.2 (Constraint Satisfaction). We say that a ground substitution ρ satisfies a constraint

c, and we write ρ ⊢ c, if the corresponding subtyping relation(s) in the right hand side of the

definitions below hold(s):

ρ ⊢ τ ≤ α
�
ρ (τ) ≤ ρ (α)

ρ ⊢ τ ≤ Call(τ1
ε−→ τ2)
�
ρ (τ) ≤ ρ
�
τ1
ε−→ τ2
�

ρ ⊢ τ ≤ Pred(P, τ ′)
�
ρ (τ :: P) ≤ ρ (τ ′)

ρ ⊢ τ ≤ Get ({f : τ ′})
�
ρ (τ) ≤ ρ ({f : τ ′})

ρ ⊢ τ ≤ Set ({f : τ ′})
�
ρ (τ) ≤ ρ ({f : τ ′})

ρ ⊢ ε ≤ ω
�
ρ (ε) ≤ ρ (ω)

ρ ⊢ ε ≤ Havoc (Γ)
�
∀x ∈ ρ (ε) . G(x) ≤ ∆(x)

where ρ (Γ) = ∆; G

Definition A.3 (Constraint Set Satisfaction under Substitution). We say that a ground substitution

ρ satisfies a constraint set C, and we write ρ ⊢ C, if for all c of C it holds that ρ ⊢ c.

The following proposition connects constraint set consistency that was discussed in Section 3.3

with constraint satisfiability under ground substitution defined above.

Proposition A.4 (Constraint Set Satisfaction). A (saturated) constraint set C is satisfiable,

iff there exists ground substitution ρ s.t. ρ ⊢ C.

A.4
Polarities

In Section 3.2, we introduced Rule CP-P-Trans that contained the notion of a “positive type hole”.
To define this formally we first introduce polar types, which can be positive or negative. A positive
type τ + is a type used to to describe outputs, whereas a negative type τ − describes inputs. Similar
definitions hold for effects (ε+ and ε−). Formally:

τ +
::= b | τ −
1
ε+
−−→ τ +
2 |
�
f1 : τ +
1 , . . . , fn : τ +
n
�
| α | τ +
1 ⊔ τ +
2

τ −
::= b | τ +
1
ε−
−−→ τ −
2 |
�
f1 : τ −
1 , . . . , fn : τ −
n
�
| α

ε+
::= ⊥ | x | ω | ε+
1 ⊔ ε+
2
ε−
::= ⊥ | x | ω

With this in mind we now define a type context t as a type that contains a hole ⟨ ⟩ in one of its
leafs. Type contexts also come in two flavors:

t+
::= b | t−
1
ε+
−−→ t+
2 |
�
f1 : t+
1 , . . . , fn : t+
n
�
| α | t+
1 ⊔ t+
2 | ⟨⟩

t−
::= b | t+
1
ε−
−−→ t−
2 |
�
f1 : t−
1 , . . . , fn : t−
n
�
| α

The critical part in the above definition is that negative contexts t− do not contain joins at their
top-levels.

DECLARATIVE TYPE SYSTEM

In Figures 15, 16 and 17 we define a declarative type system that assigns types to expressions and
statements of FlowCore. The typing judgments for expressions and statements are:

∆; G ⊩ e : τ; ε; ψ

⊩

∆′
∆; G ⊩ s : ε

⊩

∆′

Here types τ are identical in structure to the types introduced for the inference system but are
concrete, i.e. there contain no type variables. As mentioned earlier, environments ∆ bind variables
x to types τ (instead of type entries containing both a precise and a general type). The most general
type for each variable is included in environment G– a flow-insensitive structure that gathers the
most general type (globally) for each variable across the entire program. Thanks to α-renaming
each defined variable to a unique name, there is no ambiguity among variable identifiers.
Effects ε are also concrete in this declarative system. This means that they can now be directly
interpreted as sets of variables (since no effect variables are presents).
We use the shorthand eraseG(∆) to denote the erasure of an environment ∆ with the types of
G. This operation effectively creates a new environment binding all variables in ∆ to their bound
types in G. We also introduce the variant eraseε
G (∆), where ε is a concrete effect, to denote the
environment ∆[x �→ G(x) | x ∈ ε ].
Environment join (⊔) and environment refinement (::) have similar definitions as in their con-
straint generation counterparts of Figure 5, and so are omitted here.

RUNTIME TYPING

Stating a progress and preservation theorem requires us to extend the notion of well-typed expres-
sions and statements to runtime configurations.

C.1
Term Typing

Expressions & Statements. First we extend typing to runtime expressions. The judgment form is
similar to the one for static expressions with the difference that we have to include locations ℓ in
the set of typeable expressions. To do that we equip our judgment with an additional argument,
the heap typing Σ, defined as:
Σ ::= · | Σ, ℓ: τ

The expression typing judgment becomes:

∆; G ⊩Σ e : τ; ε; ψ

⊩

∆′

Extending the rules for expression typing in Figures 15 and 16 to runtime expressions is straight-
forward. An important addition is the rule for location ℓ typing:

Σ(ℓ) = τ

∆; G ⊩Σ ℓ: τ; ⊥; ∅

⊩

∆
[T-Loc]

Similarly the form of typing runtime statements is extended to:

∆; G ⊩Σ s : ε

⊩

∆′

Evaluation Contexts. A more interesting situation arises when we try to extend the judgment
to evaluation contexts E. The main issue here is that the object under judgment contains a “hole”
where another expression is expected to appear. To address this we include a “hole” in the type
structure of the return type to host the type of the term that is expected to fill in the hole of the
evaluation context. The linked effect and predicate are handled in a similar fashion:

∆; G ⊩Σ E: τ ′⟨τ⟩; ε′⟨ε⟩; ψ ′⟨ψ⟩

⊩

∆′

Figure 18 contains a selection of rules for this judgment.
When inverting typing relations, we often need to decompose the typing of filled evaluation
contexts E⟨e⟩. The following lemma deconstructs the typing of such an expression to the typing of
a bare evaluation context E and a typing of the filling expression e.

Proof. By examining all possible cases of typing evaluation contexts E, we will always type the

expression e in the “hole” first and then the evaluation context E.
□

C.2
Configuration Typing

A runtime configuration in FlowCore contains the runtime state, that itself comprises a heap H, a
stack X and a store L, and a program term. Typing configurations amounts to typing their subparts.
Before we move on to that we define two auxiliary functions.

Auxiliary Functions. The first one is the environment composition M ◦ N. This operation works
in the usual way. The range of environment N needs to be compatible with the domain of M,
otherwise the result is undefined:

(M ◦ N)(x) =

�
M(N(x))
if X ∈ dom(N) and N(x) ∈ dom(M)
undefined
otherwise

The second operator is the environment override M ⊕ N. This operator produces an environment
whose domain is the union of the domains of the two arguments. For each one of its arguments the
override first attempts to return a binding by looking it up in environment M; if this fails it tries N;
and finally returns undefined if it fails there as well.

(M ⊕ N)(x) =





M(x)
if x ∈ dom(M)
N(x)
if x ∈ dom(N) \\ dom(M)
undefined
otherwise

Stack. The form of the stack is reminiscent of the evaluation context, so the judgment we use
here has the following form:
G ⊩Σ X: τ ⟨τ ′⟩

Figure 19 contains the rules for this judgment. The interesting rule here is Rule RT-Stack-C, that
types a stack X, L.E. Following the flow of execution the rule first checks the frame E that is on

the top of the stack and then proceeds with the remaining stack X. What is interesting here is
the construction of the environment used for checking X. Assume ∆′ the output environment
after checking E. This environment contains the most recent updates of all the variables that were
assigned to in E. Our goal here is to construct an accurate heap typing Σ′ that corresponds to the
state of the heap at the end of E. This heap typing will subsequently be used to check X. To do that,
for every variable x such that x : ℓ ∈ L, i.e. in scope at the beginning of E, we require its type to be
looked up in ∆′. This amounts to ∆′ ◦ L−1. The rest will just be looked up in the incoming Σ.

Heap. Figure 20 shows the rules for checking a heap H against a heap typing Σ. The most
interesting case here is that of record typing by Rule RT-Heap-Rec. This rule infers a type for each
value vi stored at some field of the record and then unifies this type with the type of each field
specified in the store typing Σ.

Configuration. Finally, Figure 21 shows the typing rules for runtime configurations where the
terms are either expressions, function bodies or statements. These largely follow the same principles
as the typing for stacks that we saw earlier.

PROOFS

This section contains a statement and proof of soundness of the inference type system of Section 3
with respect to the declarative system of Section 5.1, followed by our type safety result for the
declarative system and by extension the entire type system.

D.1
Type Inference Soundness
The following lemma captures the intuition behind the “havoc” mechanism, as the erasure of the
part of the widened environment that is affected by the reaching effect.

Lemma D.1 (Havoc). If

(i) widen(Γ) = Γ′ ▷ C

(ii) C′ ⊇ C ∪ { ω ≤ Havoc (Γ′) }

(iii) ρ ⊢ C′

then

∆′ = eraseρ(ω)
G
(∆)

where ρ (Γ) = ∆; G and ρ (Γ′) = ∆′; G.

Proof. Let ρ (ω) = ε. For every variable x ∈ ε, it also holds that x ≤ Havoc (Γ′) ∈ C′, since C′ is

saturated. Let Γ′(x) = τ α. By Rule CP-Havoc on the binding for x, it holds that α ≤ τ ∈ C′. Due

to (iii), ρ (α) ≤ ρ (τ). Which is also written as G(x) ≤ ∆(x). But by definition of G it holds that

∆(x) ≤ G(x), so it must be that ∆(x) = G(x). Generalizing for all variables in ρ (ω) we prove the

wanted.

Type Safety

of Section 5.1 with the runtime semantics of Section 4. First we set up a number of auxiliary lemmas
and then proceed with a Preservation Theorem (D.9) and a Progress Theorem (D.10) that are later
combined to produce a Type Safety Theorem (D.12).

Let H0 = H′
0, ℓ′ �→ �v′. (D.10.18) becomes:

The subtyping constraint (D.10.11) and (D.10.23) lead to a contradiction.

G ⊩Σ H0, ℓ �→ ⟨L0, (x) ⇒ {s0; return e0}⟩

which proves the desired result immediately.

∗ RT-Heap-Rec: Similar to rule RT-Heap-Const.

So there exist L0, s0 and e0 s.t.:

H(ℓ) = ⟨L0, (x) ⇒ {s0; return e0}⟩

We pick:

H′ = H, ℓv �→ v, ℓi �→ undefined

X′ = X, L.⟨ ⟩
(D.10.27)

L′ = L0, x �→ ℓv, xi �→ ℓi
(D.10.28)

where xi are the variables defined in the function body, and ℓv and ℓi are fresh locations.

By applying Rule RT-Call using (D.10.25), (D.10.26), (D.10.27) and (D.10.28)

S; ℓ(v) −→ ⟨H′; X′; L′⟩; {s0; return e0}
(D.10.29)

which proves (b).

– T-Var, T-Assign, T-Fun, T-And, T-Or, T-Not and T-Pred are straight-forward since they

only impose very minimal preconditions for the respective transition to happen.
